# VerseWatcher - Star Citizen Event Notifier

A real-time game.log monitoring tool ive made for Star Citizen. It tracks and notifies you of in-game events of simple but highly useful events and its details. 

This is a very early WIP of this tool. This is basically using tech ive been developing for a bigger project still in development and iv'e decided to make a more simple tool that does some of the useful stuff of the bigger project, so this is what it has become. I do plan to add more features to this tool in the future over time and keep it up to date with the latest changes in the game.

## Usefulness

- Keep track of player names, time/date, weapon used, ship used of players and NPC have killed or that had killed you

- Works with any version (LIVE, PTU, etc..)

- Works in Persistent Universe and Arena Commander Modes
